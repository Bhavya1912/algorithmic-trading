# Algorithmic Trading

This repository contains three notebooks implementing different algorithmic trading strategies. Each strategy focuses on a specific investment approach and provides recommendations for constructing an equal-weight portfolio.

## Notebook 1: Equal-Weight S&P 500 Index Fund

The goal of this notebook is to create a Python script that calculates the number of shares to purchase for each constituent of the S&P 500 index in order to replicate an equal-weight version of the index fund. The S&P 500 is one of the most popular stock market indices globally, and the largest fund benchmarked to this index is the SPDR® S&P 500® ETF Trust, managing over US$250 billion in assets.

## Notebook 2: Quantitative Momentum Strategy

This notebook focuses on a quantitative momentum strategy for investing. Momentum investing involves selecting stocks that have exhibited significant price increases. In this project, we will construct an investing strategy that identifies the 50 stocks with the highest price momentum. We will then calculate recommended trades for an equal-weight portfolio consisting of these 50 stocks.

## Notebook 3: Quantitative Value Strategy

The quantitative value strategy implemented in this notebook emphasizes investing in stocks that are considered undervalued based on common measures of business value, such as earnings or assets. The project aims to construct an investing strategy that selects the 50 stocks with the best value metrics. We will subsequently calculate recommended trades for an equal-weight portfolio comprising these 50 stocks.

Feel free to explore each notebook to understand the methodology, code implementation, and results of each strategy. Please note that investing involves risks, and the strategies presented here are for educational purposes only.
